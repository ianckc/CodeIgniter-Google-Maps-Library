A CodeIgniter library to produce Google Maps and associated functionality

Copy the file google_maps.php into your library directory and then load the library using either the autoload in application/config/autoload.php or with the following in a controller

$this->load->library('google_maps');

As well as adding the output function in your view

echo $this->google_maps->output();

Functions

create

This function needs to be called before any other function.

It creates a basic map and sets it's center and the zoom level.

The function accepts an optional parameter of an array containing the options you want to override. These are

elementId - The id of the HTML tag you will use to hold your map. If none is declared it defaults to map
sensor - This tells Google Maps if you will be using geolocation to detect a user's position. Pass in a string of true or false. Defaults to false
centerLat - The latitude you wish to focus the map on. Defaults to 0
centerLng - The longitude you wish to focus the map on. Defaults to 0
mapTypeId - Google Maps can display different styles of map depending on your application's needs. The options are
HYBRID 	This map type displays a transparent layer of major streets on satellite images.
ROADMAP 	This map type displays a normal street map.
SATELLITE 	This map type displays satellite images.
TERRAIN 	This map type displays maps with physical features such as terrain and vegetation.
Defaults to ROADMAP
zoom - How far in you want to zoom on the map. Accepts an integer between 0 and 21. Defaults to 0

add_markers

This function can add one or more markers to the map.

It accepts a multi dimensional array. Each sub array must contain a lat and long value and can also contain optional keys of

infoWindowHtml - If you want an info window to appear when the marker is clicked pass in the HTML you want the window to contain

An example of adding two markers to a map, one with an info window, would look like the following

$markers[0]['lat']	= '50.3697';
$markers[0]['lng']	= '-4.1399';

$markers[1]['lat']				= '50.2697';
$markers[1]['lng']				= '-4.0399';
$markers[1]['infoWindowHTML']	= '<h1>My info window</h1><p>Some more info can go in here</p>';
				
extract_lat_lng

If you want to extract the lat lng values from a click on the map you can use this function.

It requires two parameters. The id of the latitude and longitude inputs that you want to populate.
